## About Me

I am currently a freshman ---> going into my sophomore year at [Allegheny College](https://allegheny.edu/). I'm an Integrative Informatics and Environmental Science Double major because I love nature and technology! I was
born in Troy, Alabama. However, I was raised in the beautiful city of Erie, PA!
While in Erie I attended Fort Leboeuf High School, where I played Football, Track
and Field, and wrestling.

Some of my hobbies include :

*  Hunting
*  Fishing
*  Weightlifting
*  Playing with my dog
*  Rugby

After college I hope to take an interesting route that would surprise most people.
Using both of the majors I am pursuing, I hope to integrate technology into the
world of farming. I plan to pursue both agricultural and animal farming careers
in a way that I can use programs to my advantage.
