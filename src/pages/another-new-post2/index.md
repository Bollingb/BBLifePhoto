My pets are some of the things I love most in this world, so here's a small look at them!

## Charlie

This is my black lab Charlie! He is currently two years old and is **FILLED** with unnatural amounts of energy. We got him from my aunt and have been loving him ever since!

## Tyson, Fluffy, Oreo

These are my cats Tyson, Fluffy, and Oreo! Tyson is the youngest at four years old, while the other two have been with me for quite a while. I had even gotten Oreo when I lived in Atlanta in first grade!
