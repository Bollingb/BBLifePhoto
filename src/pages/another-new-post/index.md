_My mom and brother are the two people I lookup to the most, and are one of the biggest motivations for me here at Allegheny!_

## My Mom Valerie

I am very close with my family so I knew I had to put them somewhere in my collection of pictures. My mom's name is Valerie, and she works at an animal clinic.

## My Brother Jacob

I am also very close with my brother Jacob. He currently attends Gannon University and is studying Pre-Med! He is the one directly next to me wearing a blue sweater in the picture below.
